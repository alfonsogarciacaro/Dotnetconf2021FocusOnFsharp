# dotNETConf 2021 Focus on F#

These are the code samples shown at the Fable talk in [dotNETConf 2021 Focus on F#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3qEhwcG7ps). To try it out, clone the repo and then run `npm install && npm start`. The repo uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the development server for fast hot reloading.

There are three pages/components. Comment/Uncomment the lines in `Playground.fs` to display one or the other. These are React components written in F# using Fable.React bindings with some helpers for Bootstrap, see `Bootstrap.fs` file. Note the CSS classes from Bootstrap and FontAwesome are typed thanks to [Zanaptak.TypedCssClasses](https://github.com/zanaptak/TypedCssClasses). The components use [Feliz.ReactComponent](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/Feliz/ReactApiSupport) attribute and React hooks to emulate Elmish-like components. For simplicity, Elmish commands (asynchronous actions) are not used, if you need them check [Feliz UseElmish](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/Hooks/UseElmish) or full [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/) apps.

The first two components are examples adapted from Maxime's [Fable.Form](https://mangelmaxime.github.io/Fable.Form/). This repo contains some code to adapt Fable.Form to Bootstrap (see `Fable.Form.Bootstrap.fs`) and also some helpers to reduce the boilerplate to declare the form fields (see `Form.Make` type).

The last component calls [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/) API and displays a table with sorting and filtering capabilities. The code to interact with Petstore API is in the `PetStore` and it's completely generated by Zaid's [Hawaii](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Hawaii).
